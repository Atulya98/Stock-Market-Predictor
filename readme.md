# Repository Name

## Description
This repository contains code for predicting stock market trends using machine learning algorithms, specifically focusing on the S&P 500 index. The code utilizes historical data, feature engineering techniques, and a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether the stock prices will increase or decrease.

## Files

- **main.py**: Python script containing the main code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
- **sp500.csv**: CSV file containing historical data of the S&P 500 index.
- **README.md**: Markdown file providing information about the repository.
- **requirements.txt**: Text file listing the required dependencies for running the code.

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` script to execute the code.
4. Check the predictions generated by the model.

## Usage
- `main.py`: This script loads historical S&P 500 data, preprocesses it, engineers features, trains a Random Forest Classifier, and generates predictions.
- `sp500.csv`: Contains historical data of the S&P 500 index.
- `README.md`: Provides information about the repository, its contents, and instructions for usage.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the code.
